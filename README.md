# Introduction
## what is Keybox
It is an alternative version of keypass. It is written by CPP and QT, so it can run on Window/Linux/macOS natively 
will have android and iOS versions as well. Sync service based on AWS lambda is also include.

Keypass is good, except it is a little bit complex for me, and it doesn't have the sync feature.
